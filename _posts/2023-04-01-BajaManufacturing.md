*2022 - 2024*

As part of the Baja SAE team at UMD, Terps Racing, I learned many manufacturing processes to produce parts for the ATV:
- Manual mill
- Manual lathe
- 3 and 5 axis CNC mill
- Waterjet
- Sheet metal bending

This page highlights some of the parts I've made.

## Clevis

Machined aluminum on a 3-axis CNC (Prototrak DPM RX3). CAM program created in Fusion 360.
The clevis is part of the steering assembly, connecting the steering rack to a tie rod.

## 4WD Activation Ramp

Machined aluminum on a 5-axis CNC (PocketNC V2-10). CAM program created in Autodesk Inventor.
This part rotates to activate the ATV's 4WD clutch.

## Belt Tensioner Arm

Machined steel on a waterjet and a 3-axis CNC.
The CNC program involved flattening the top and bottom faces, and machining a bearing bore in the center.
This part connects to a spring and pivots around the bearing to tension a belt loop.

## Belt Tensioner Shaft

Steel turned on a manual lathe.
This part was my introduction to machining bearing fits.
This part connected a belt pulley to the tensioner arm.

## CVT Case

Without a sheet metal roller in the shop, I had to get creative to bend a 7.5 inch-wide sheet of aluminum.
I used a hydraulic press with a custom die to bend the sheet into shape.
The sheet was welded onto a waterjet peice to mount to the engine.
This part encased the CVT, the heart of the ATV's powertrain, to protect it from debris and mud.
It also protects people near the car in case of a rapid unscheduled disassembly of the CVT.

## My First Jig

When joining the team, new members are trained on the manual mill by making a jig out of aluminum. This was mine!
I learned how to fixture stock, use an edge finder, compensate for backlash, and read a DRO to make parts accurate to a thousanth of an inch.
