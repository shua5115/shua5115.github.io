PGolf is a game I made while working at TIC as a programming counselor in 2021.
I created it to inspire campers, showcasing what was possible in Processing (the environment we were using to teach Java).
This was one of the first 3D games I created, and I still play it occasionally.

Through the development process, I learned many concepts of 3D game programming:
- Matrix and vector math
- OpenGL Model, View, and Projection matrices
- 3D physics and physics engine programming
- Procedural terrain generation with noise
- User Inferface design patterns

I applied what I learned in my AP physics class to code my own physics engine.
It is very simple, only able to collide a sphere with static level geometry, but it gets the job done for a golf game.
