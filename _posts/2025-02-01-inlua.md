I created a new programming language called Inline Lua, or "Inlua". In the process, I learned about parsers, interpreters, systems programming, test-driven development, C debugging tools, and over 10k lines of Lua source code. The idea for Inlua started in a conversation with a friend: a programming language that replaces all if-statements with ternary expressions. I was motivated to see the idea to fruition, excited to learn how programming languages work along the way.

After an initial web search, I found and read the book ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball to understand the basics of making a programming language from scratch. I followed along and finished the book's example language, which introduced me to test-driven development. With this, I was ready to begin work on Inlua. My goal was to have Inlua compile to Lua bytecode so I would only be concerned with parsing and compiling.

I started by investigating Lua bytecode generation. To ensure I understood it, I wrote a bytecode program by hand. In contrast to the simplicity of Lua bytecode, generating it is not simple. I spent several days taking notes on every single function in Lua's parser and code generator, describing each in my own words. This exercise led to a deep understanding of the Lua codebase, making me confident that I could complete the project. I decided to modify Lua to become Inlua, since Lua's parser turned out to operate similarly to the one described in the book.

After a week, I successfully modified Lua's syntax to be like Inlua. However, not all features were implemented and there were memory errors and bugs. I learned how to use Valgrind to track memory errors and GDB to understand any buggy behavior. After many cycles of implementing features, writing tests, and debugging, Inlua was done.

In this project, I demonstrate my ability to learn quickly and independently, understand complex systems, and implement changes with a high attention to detail.
