*Digital Twin for a Universal Robots Arm*

Over two summers I contributed to research supporting the ISO 23247 standard for Digital Twins in Manufacturing.

The first summer I was part of NIST's SURF program contributing to research in the Digital Twins Lab.
My task was to apply a general procedure for digital twin development defined in the draft ISO 23247.
A digital twin is a synchronized digital model of a real-life object, and the digital twin I created was of a Universal Robots UR5e robot arm.

The second summer I performed research at NIST through UMD's PREP program, continuing to contribute to the Digital Twins Lab.
That year, the draft ISO 23247 standard was updated to include the concept of a Digital Twin Composition (DTC),
where digital twins are combined to model larger systems in a scalable fashion.
I applied the standard's procedure to develop a DTC of a UR5e digital twin with a gripper digital twin.

Through this research, I learned and practiced many skills related to software development and data analysis for robotics.
During the first summer, I became familiar with techniques and tools to model, analyze, and control UR robot arms, such as UR's APIs, networking protocols, and physics simulation tools.
In between the summers, I taught myself C++ and CMake, which made it possible for me to write high-performance and scalable systems with ROS 2.
During the second summer, I became intensely familiar with the system architecture of ROS, which I can apply to future robotics development projects.
To ensure the proper operation of the robots and their digital twins, I had to collect and filter large amounts of data in real-time to check for discrepancies from expected values.
