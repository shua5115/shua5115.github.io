MindMapper is a node-graph editor I created to complete a single school project.
The project required us to create a "Mind Map" about a certain topic using an online node-graph editor.
The experience of using the online software was horrible. Its user interface was bloated and was always popping up requests to buy the "pro" version.
All I needed was boxes with text connected with arrows. In the online software, it took me about 15 seconds to create two boxes and connect them with an arrow.
In the software I created, I bound all of these actions to the mouse, allowing the same task to be completed with two mouse clicks in under a second.
I was able to write the first version of MindMapper and complete the assignment in one week.

This was the first editor-type software I created. It has these amazing features:
- Nodes and arrows can both contain text
- Save/load graph to a JSON file
- Export graph as an image
- Copy/paste text between nodes
- Only runs when user is interacting to use less system resources
