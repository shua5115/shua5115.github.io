MindMapper is a graph editor I created to complete a single school project.
The project required us to create a mind map about a certain topic, and recommended using a certain online graph editor.
The experience of using the online editor was painfully slow, making it difficult to let ideas flow.
It required many clicks to create, position, and format each node, and it would constantly pop up requests to buy the "pro" version.
All I needed was boxes with text connected with arrows.
So, I resolved to create my own, and to finish it before the assignment was due.
I designed the UI so any action in the program could be done in a single click, using different mouse buttons for different behavior.

It also has these amazing features:
- Boxes and arrows can both contain text
- Save/load graph to a JSON file
- Export graph as an image
- Copy/paste text between nodes
- Reduces system load by only running when the user is interacting
