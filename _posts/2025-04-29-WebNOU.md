[Play NOU](https://shwaa.ddns.net:8080/nou)

NOU is a game inspired by UNO.
I created it so I would be able to play this type of game with my friends online, now that we've gone to different places in the world.
It is based on the OnlineNOU game I made with Java in Processing, showcased [here]({% post_url 2023-03-17-OnlineNOU %}).
I developed the new version in the Godot game engine.
To host the game and distribute it over the network, I established a server using NGINX to handle HTTPS connections and serve files.

The game itself has the following features:
- A lobby system, so the server can host many players and games simultaneously.
- A voting system for players to choose game rules
- Served as a Progressive Web App, allowing users to have the game client as an app on their device

To make delivery on the web quicker, I used several tricks to decrease the file size of the game:
- Cards are pixel art, allowing for a small texture size.
- Card faces are in a texture atlas, allowing for efficient compression of repeated features.
- Art uses mostly solid colors, which makes compression even more effective.
