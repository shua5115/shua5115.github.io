*Powertrain Subteam at Williamsport Competition (I'm in the middle)*


## Responsibilities

- Coordinated a team of 10+ students to design and manufacture a custom ATV powertrain
- Created student projects each semester
- Reviewed designs for compliance with competition rules and manufacturability
- Taught new members engineering skills: machining, CAD, CAM, CNC
- Managed the budget for ordering raw material and off-the-shelf parts


## Training Lectures

I created these lectures to highlight information about CAD assemblies and FEA in Solidworks beyond what is taught in classes, along with conventions specific to our team, so new members are informed about how to use Solidworks to complete complex tasks.
