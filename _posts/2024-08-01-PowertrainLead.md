## Responsibilities
- Coordinated a team of 10+ students to design and manufacture a custom ATV powertrain
- Created student projects each semester
- Reviewed designs for compliance with competition rules and manufacturability
- Taught new members engineering skills: machining, CAD, CAM, CNC
- Managed the budget for ordering raw material and off-the-shelf parts

## Impact
- Improved acceleration time from 5.98s to 4.34s
- Placed 16th of 107 at Pennsylvania competition, Summer 2024
    - Placed 23rd in acceleration ranking
- Placed 22nd of 86 at Michigan competition, Fall 2024
    - Placed 12th in acceleration ranking

## Training Lectures

I created these lectures to highlight information about CAD assemblies and FEA in Solidworks beyond what is taught in classes, along with conventions specific to our team, so new members are informed about how to use Solidworks to complete complex tasks.
