## Responsibilities
- Product design
- Robot programming
- Circuit design
- CAD modeling
- UI/UX design
- Stakeholder outreach
- Accounting (budget and BOM)
- 3D printing
- Product testing

In Fall of 2023 and 2024 I volunteered with VME to develop a device to help people with quadriplegia or other disabilities to eat meals more independently.
The device features a robot arm with a spoon attachment, along with a rotating platform for a bowl or plate.
This design allows for the unique capability of using different utensils and tableware with the device, making usable with kitchenware customers already own, further decreasing cost.
To support this feature, the scooping motion is intuitively reprogrammable, allowing the robot arm to compensate for differently shaped spoons, bowls, or plates.
The device is similar to existing assistive feeding devices, but is designed to be made at very low cost with mostly off-the-shelf and 3D-printed components.
The reason for low cost is to make the device accessible to people in countries with fewer medical resources.

In 2023, I was primarily responsible for programming the device's robot arm and user interface. I also tested the device to ensure proper functionality.

In 2024, I redesigned physical parts of the robot to be more robust and easier to assemble/repair, and helped a new team member improve the UI/UX code.

Since this project is still under development and will see contributions from future student teams, I helped create comprehensive documentation. This includes:
- Weekly meeting notes
- Recorded meetings with stakeholders
- Code documentation (code comments and a website generated with Doxygen)
- A detailed bill of materials
- An instruction booklet for assembly, operation, and troubleshooting
