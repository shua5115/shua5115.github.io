My design project during the 2024 Baja SAE season was the front shaft of the ATV.
I analyzed the design with hand calculations and FEA, considering several failure modes:
- Shear
- Torsion
- Fatigue
- Stress concentration at diameter stepdown
- Stress concentration at keyways
- Sprag clutch torque limit
- Bearing radial force limits
